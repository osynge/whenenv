When Env
~~~~~~~~

whenenv is designed to keep the branching involved in build and 
functional test scripts from growing out of control.

You specify a list of enviroment variables and whenenv will then 
try and reuse existing scritps to process the request.

If it fails to find suitable scripts you shoudl specify soem minium script.

When launching whenenv, always specify the PRODUCT enviroment variable. The components of the build are isolated and reusable.




Background.
~~~~~~~~~~
When env was originally simple application for doing continuous builds.

Jenkins is a very flexable tool for doing automated builds. 

Using Jenkins I became frustrated, but soem tools like the jenkins 
"Configuration Matrix" plugin make Jenkisn a tool for portability testing.
Using this "Configuration Matrix" plugin in Jenkins Builds led to this 
application.


Attempts to make all jenkins "Configuration Matrix" jobs look like:


Xample usage in Jenkins.



Script:
